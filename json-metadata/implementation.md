# Implementation Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a sub-folder of the various implementations of imagery specifications that are active in the world. Each sub-folder should have a valid json document of its latest implementation, as well as one or more documents discussing. If it is not in json then another implementation file can be used (xml, etc) 

To add an implementation create the following:

* a new folder name (alpha_numberic any replacing spaces with underscore '_') 
* a new json file {folder_name}/{folder_name}.json

Once this is complete, please  add it to the 'In Collaboration' list below
