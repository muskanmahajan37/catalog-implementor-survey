## Introduction

Radiant.Earth v1.0 specification is based on Raster Foundry's API which supports creating, searching, and analyzing imagery and raster data. With Raster Foundry's API users are
able to gain insight from geospatial data quickly, repeatably, and at any scale. The API powers [Radiant.Earth Platform](https://app.radiant.earth) the web application and a [python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rasterfoundry/0.1.0) that exposes the API in a pythonic interface.
Data is added to Raster Foundry from public sources like Landsat and Sentinel archives and allows users to add their own imagery or
raster data obtained via satellite, drones, manned flights, or other means. Access to the API requires an API key and at this time
signups are limited to a small set of users during beta testing.

The portion of Raster Foundry's spec provided here excludes resources and endpoints that are not relevant to catalog functionality. The
full specification can be obtained at https://spec.radiant.earth and the [documentation site](https://doc.radiant.earth) includes
additional information on the full API functionality.
